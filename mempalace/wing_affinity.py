"""wing_affinity.py — Score which wings are relevant to a query.

Given a search query, computes a relevance score for each wing in the
palace using existing structural signals. ``search_memories`` uses these
scores for opt-in additive cross-wing expansion: when an unfiltered
baseline returns fewer hits than requested, the best-scoring wings get
their own scoped queries and their deduped hits append after the
baseline — baseline hits keep their slots and their order.

The scoring is query-time only — no writes to the KG, no sidecar tables,
no synthetic facts.

Structural signals used:

1. **Passive same-room connections** from collection metadata via
   ``find_tunnels()``/``build_graph()`` — a room name that appears in
   multiple wings marks those wings as covering the same topic. These
   are *derived* connections, not the explicit ``tunnels.json`` links.
2. **Hallway entity overlap** from ``hallways.json`` (palace-scoped) —
   query tokens matching entity names boost the wing holding them.
3. **Room name token overlap** within the same graph.

Target isolation: ``config`` must be bound to the target's
``palace_path``/``collection_name`` — ``build_graph``'s warm cache is
keyed on that identity and the sqlite fast path serves it. Passing an
explicit ``col`` bypasses the cache and forces a full metadata scan, so
callers should prefer the config-keyed path.

    Scoring signals:

       that collection metadata places in multiple wings, those wings get
       a boost. Strongest signal: the room name IS the topic, and the
       connection says it spans wings.
    2. Hallway entity overlap — if query tokens match entity names in
       hallway records, the wing containing those hallways gets a boost.

       match query tokens, that wing is likely relevant even without
